# Codecademy Learn Python Challenges and Projects

Hello, Python world!

As I'm trying to practice some Python coding in order to get into Data Science, I decided to create this repository to keep all challenges and off-platform projects from [Codecademy Learn Python Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3).

Additionally, maintaning and updating this repository is a way for me put into practice my knowledge of command line (bash), Git and Github and also to practice some english writing.
